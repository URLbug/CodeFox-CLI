## 🦊 Overview

**CodeFox-CLI** is an intelligent automated code review system that takes over routine security and code quality checks, allowing senior developers to focus on architecture and complex tasks.

Unlike traditional linters, CodeFox understands the context of the entire project and its business logic, delivering not just review comments but ready-to-apply fixes with **Auto-Fix**.

## ⚙️ Configuration

**Ignore file:** `./.codefoxignore`
Specifies paths that should not be uploaded to the File Store.

**Model settings:** `./.codefox.yml`
Used for fine-grained configuration of the analysis behavior and model parameters (such as model selection, temperature, review rules, baseline, and prompts).
For detailed configuration options and examples, see [wiki](WIKI.md).

**Token configuration:** `./codefoxenv`
Stores the API token for the model. This file is used by the CLI for authentication and should not be committed to version control.
